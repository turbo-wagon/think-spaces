# think-spaces
**Think Spaces** is a personal development and creative exploration project — a system of persistent, thematic “cognitive rooms” where each space revolves around an idea, topic, or concept.   Within each space, users can collect links, notes, images, and ideas, and connect AI agents or models to help think, create, or explore.
