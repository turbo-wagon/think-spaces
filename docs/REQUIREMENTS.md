# üìã Functional & Non-Functional Requirements ‚Äî Think Spaces

## 1. Overview
**Think Spaces** is a personal development and creativity platform designed to organize and explore ideas through interactive, AI-enhanced ‚Äúspaces.‚Äù  
Each space acts as a thematic environment where users can collect text, images, and links, and collaborate with AI agents to think, synthesize, and create.

This document defines the functional, non-functional, and system requirements guiding the design and implementation of Think Spaces.

## 2. Functional Requirements

| ID | Category | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **F-1** | Space Management | The system shall allow users to create, rename, and delete *Think Spaces*. | High |
| **F-2** | Artifact Management | The system shall allow users to add, view, edit, and remove *artifacts* (text, links, images, notes) within a space. | High |
| **F-3** | Categorization | Each artifact shall include metadata (type, tags, timestamp, source, etc.). | Medium |
| **F-4** | Persistence | The system shall persist all spaces and artifacts using a local database (SQLite) or a lightweight JSON store. | High |
| **F-5** | AI Agent Integration | The system shall allow assignment of one or more AI agents to each space. | High |
| **F-6** | Agent Context Awareness | Agents shall access the artifacts and metadata of their assigned space to provide contextual responses. | Medium |
| **F-7** | Natural Language Interaction | The system shall provide an interface for users to communicate with agents using free text. | High |
| **F-8** | Search & Retrieval | Users shall be able to search within and across spaces based on keywords, tags, or semantic similarity. | Medium |
| **F-9** | Visualization | The system shall visualize relationships between artifacts and agents (e.g., graph or map view). | Low |
| **F-10** | Export & Backup | Users shall be able to export a space (and its artifacts) as Markdown, JSON, or ZIP. | Medium |
| **F-11** | Settings Management | Users shall be able to configure API keys, preferences, and storage options through a simple settings UI. | Low |
| **F-12** | Space Evolution | The system shall record and version key changes to a space over time (e.g., timeline or snapshots). | Medium |
| **F-13** | Offline Mode | The system shall function in offline mode using local storage, syncing to cloud when available. | Medium |
| **F-14** | Authentication (Future) | The system may later support user accounts for multi-user collaboration. | Future |

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Category | Requirement | Target |
|----|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **NF-1** | Performance | API responses (LLM requests excluded) shall complete within 500 ms. | < 0.5s |
| **NF-2** | Reliability | No data loss between sessions; autosave every 30 seconds. | 99% data retention |
| **NF-3** | Scalability | The architecture shall support transition from SQLite ‚Üí PostgreSQL or Cosmos DB. | Phase 2 |
| **NF-4** | Extensibility | Agents, storage backends, or frontends shall be pluggable modules. | Ongoing |
| **NF-5** | Usability | UI shall be minimal, intuitive, and accessible (WCAG 2.1 compliant where possible). | High |
| **NF-6** | Security | All API keys stored securely in `.env`; sensitive data encrypted at rest. | 100% compliance |
| **NF-7** | Portability | The system shall run locally (FastAPI) and deploy to Vercel, GitHub Pages, or Azure App Service. | Verified |
| **NF-8** | Observability | Logging and minimal metrics (requests, responses, errors) shall be available. | High |
| **NF-9** | Privacy | No user content shall be shared externally without explicit consent. | High |

## 4. System Constraints

| Type | Constraint |
|------|-------------|
| **Language** | Python 3.10+ |
| **Backend Framework** | FastAPI |
| **Frontend** | React (or Jinja templates for MVP) |
| **Database** | SQLite (MVP), PostgreSQL (scalable version) |
| **Storage** | Local-first, optional cloud sync |
| **AI Models** | Azure OpenAI / OpenAI (text + image) |
| **Deployment** | GitHub Pages / Vercel / Azure App Service |
| **Version Control** | GitHub |
| **Environment Management** | `.env` and `requirements.txt` |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

| Category | Criteria |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Core Functionality** | A user can create a new space, add artifacts, and interact with at least one AI agent. |
| **Persistence** | All artifacts and configurations are retained after restarting the app. |
| **AI Integration** | Agent can summarize or generate insights from artifacts in a space. |
| **Usability** | App can be run locally with `uvicorn` and accessed via browser. |
| **Documentation** | Charter, Design, Requirements, and Roadmap present in `/docs` directory. |

## 6. Future Enhancements

| Area | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Multi-User Collaboration** | Shared spaces with concurrent editing and permissions. |
| **Advanced Visualization** | Graph-based idea maps and AI-generated concept clusters. |
| **Memory Layer** | Agents retain historical context and learn from user feedback. |
| **Integrations** | Notion, Obsidian, and browser extensions for quick artifact capture. |
| **Mobile Interface** | Progressive Web App for iOS/Android. |
| **Voice & Image Input** | Support for speech-to-text and multimodal inputs. |
